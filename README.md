## Super Smash Bros. Stats App!

# Introduction
This project is a tool to use for the competitve scene in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. As the lead designer (Ralph), I am also a part of SWOSU's Esports team for this game. Our school is extremely competitve and has place top 8 and top 5 in the nation.
I wanted an app to aid my teammates and myself, so I created the app before you. It is designed to take in your character choices and return you statistics about specific match-ups, namely what stage your character is known to do best on.

# Data
The data retrieved for this project is based on a web scrapping of Start.gg which is the most popular website for online and offline tournaments. The data is from July 17th 2021, which is unfortunate but the best data that we could accumulate.
Eventually for the project I would like to impliment the API that Start.gg is working on but that doesn't seem like it'll be available until 2025.
